; nil or '() represent false,
; t is true, though technically anything that is not false
;   is treated as true

; and, or, not can be used for compound boolean expressions, e.g.
; (not x) ; true iff x is false
; (and x y z) ; true iff all three are true
; (or x y z) ; true if any of the three are true
